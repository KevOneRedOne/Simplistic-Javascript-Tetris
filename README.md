## Objectives
Our goal was to recreate a Tetris game from scratch using Javascript.

For those who don't know, Tetris is a really simple game which consist in completing lines to get the best score possible !

## How do you play the game ?
In order to play the game, you first have to run the program on your browser using your IDE.

Once this is done, you simply have to click on play button then enjoy the game !

You will play using the arrows on your keyboard :
- Up is for rotating the piece to the right;
- Left is for moving the piece to the left;
- Right is for moving the piece to the right;
- Down is for dropping the piece down faster.

## Additionnal Functionalities
- Score leaderboard
- Pause button
- Game runs at 60 fps
